    <p> <strong>Generative design</strong> is an iterative design process that uses software to generate outputs that fulfill a set of constraints
       iteratively adjusted by a designer. Whether a human, test program, or artificial intelligence, the designer algorithmically
        or manually refines the feasible region of the program's inputs and outputs with each iteration to fulfill evolving design requirements.
        By employing computing power to evaluate more design permutations than a human alone is capable of, the process is capable of producing an optimal design
        that mimics nature's evolutionary approach to design through genetic variation and selection. The output can be images, sounds, architectural models,
        animation, and much more. It is, therefore, a fast method of exploring design possibilities that is used in various design fields such as art, architecture,
        communication design, and product design.</p>
        
        <p>Generative design has become more important, largely due to new programming environments or scripting capabilities that have made it
          relatively easy, even for designers with little programming experience, to implement their ideas. Additionally, this process can create
          solutions to substantially complex problems that would otherwise be resource-exhaustive with an alternative approach making it a more
          attractive option for problems with a large or unknown solution set. It is also facilitated with tools in commercially available CAD 
          packages. Not only are implementation tools more accessible, but also tools leveraging generative design as a foundation.</p>
    
          <p>A key feature of generative design in sustainable design is its ability to incorporate Building Performance Simulations (BPS) into the
           design process. Simulation programs like EnergyPlus, Ladybug Tools, and so on, combined with generative algorithms, can optimize design 
          solutions for cost-effective energy use and zero-carbon building designs. For example, the GENE_ARCH system used a Pareto algorithm with DOE2.1E 
          building energy simulation for the whole building design optimization. Generative design has improved sustainable facade design, as illustrated
          by the algorithm of cellular automata and daylight simulations in adaptive facade design. In addition, genetic algorithms were used with radiation
          simulations for energy-efficient PV modules on high-rise building facades.[18] Generative design is also applied to life cycle analysis (LCA), as 
          demonstrated by a framework using grid search algorithms to optimize exterior wall design for minimum environmental embodied impact.</p>
